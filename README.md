## üí° Inspiration  
We were inspired by the growing need for accessible, privacy-first AI tools‚Äîespecially for students in low-connectivity regions. With AI shifting from cloud to device, we saw an opportunity to eliminate server costs, reduce environmental impact, and democratize innovation. Our experience in youth-led tech projects revealed gaps in inclusivity, and we designed the Hub to close them.
